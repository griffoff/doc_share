    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals with Subtle Blue Accent -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page dashboard design is chosen for its directness and ease of navigation. The structure is thematic, not linear like the report. It starts with high-level strategic recommendations (the "answer"), then allows users to dive into the details. Key sections are: 1) Strategic Scenarios: Immediately presents the core recommendations based on Cengage's goals. This is the most critical information and should be upfront. 2) Platform Deep Dive: An interactive section where users can select a specific platform to view its detailed pros, cons, and AI capabilities. This replaces a static, multi-page profile section with an engaging, user-driven comparison. 3) Comparative Analytics: Visualizes the feature and cost comparison data in charts for quick synthesis. This is more effective than dense tables. 4) Market Landscape: Provides context on the market trends. This structure prioritizes actionable insights and allows users to explore supporting data on demand, which is a more efficient user flow than reading the original report cover-to-cover. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 1) Strategic Recommendations: Report Info -> Scenario-based recommendations. Goal -> Guide decision-making. Viz/Method -> Interactive tabbed cards (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction -> Click tabs to switch between scenarios. Justification -> Allows users to quickly find the recommendation that matches their strategic priority. 2) Platform Profiles: Report Info -> Detailed pros, cons, pricing, AI features for 5 platforms. Goal -> Allow deep, on-demand comparison. Viz/Method -> Dynamic content blocks updated by a selector component (HTML/CSS/JS). Interaction -> User clicks a platform logo to populate the detail view. Justification -> Far more engaging and less overwhelming than scrolling through five long sections. 3) Feature Comparison: Report Info -> Feature matrix table. Goal -> Compare platforms across key features. Viz/Method -> Grouped Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction -> Tooltips on hover provide details. Justification -> Visualizes relative strengths and weaknesses more effectively than a text table. 4) TCO Comparison: Report Info -> Pricing & TCO table. Goal -> Compare financial investment. Viz/Method -> Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) showing estimated license cost ranges. Interaction -> Tooltips clarify cost drivers. Justification -> Makes complex pricing data easier to grasp at a glance. -->

                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If the most pressing business problem is to solve sales content chaos, increase seller effectiveness, and deploy a state-of-the-art, AI-driven playbook system, then a dedicated **Sales Enablement Platform (SEP)** is the only logical choice. These platforms are purpose-built to live within the seller's CRM and use AI to deliver the dynamic, run-time guidance Cengage requires. The final choice between them should be based on a hands-on "bake-off" to determine the best cultural and workflow fit for your sales team.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Recommendation: HubSpot</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If the primary obstacles to growth are technology sprawl, data silos, and a disconnect between sales and marketing, HubSpot presents a compelling solution. Adopting the HubSpot Customer Platform would create a single, integrated system for the entire GTM organization. This path offers data unification and operational simplicity but involves accepting a less specialized playbook toolset compared to dedicated SEPs. The risks of vendor lock-in and escalating costs must be carefully weighed.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-3">Recommendation: AEM or Sitecore + a dedicated SEP</h3>
                    <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">If the paramount objective is to optimize Cengage.com and deliver sophisticated, AI-driven personalization to millions of users, an enterprise **Digital Experience Platform (DXP)** is the correct tool. However, DXPs do not solve the sales enablement problem. The correct strategy in this scenario is a **best-of-breed approach**: invest in a DXP for the marketing-owned web experience and simultaneously invest in a dedicated SEP (Highspot or Seismic) to meet the distinct needs of the sales team.</p>
